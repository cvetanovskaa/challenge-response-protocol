# Challenge-Response Protocol Implementation

**Purpose of the project**: To simulate the working of a challenge-response protocol. This is a protocol where 
one party [the server] presents a question i.e. a challenge, and the other party [the client]  must provide a valid answer i.e.
the response, in order to be authenticated.

## Getting started

	1. Open two terminals - 1 for the server & 1 for the client
	2. After running the client choose whether you want to login or register
	3. Enter username & password
